## What is Machine Learning?

#### Actually ML is everywhere

<br>

1.  **Recommender Systems:** Machine learning algorithms are used to
    recommend products, movies, music, and other items based on a person's
    preferences and previous actions.
2.  **Fraud Detection:** Banks and financial institutions use machine
    learning algorithms to detect suspicious transactions and prevent
    fraudulent activities.
3.  **Image and Speech Recognition:** Machine learning algorithms are used
    in image and speech recognition systems, such as Siri and Google
    Assistant, to accurately transcribe and interpret user commands.
4.  **Email Filtering:** Machine learning algorithms are used to classify
    emails as spam or not spam, helping to keep inboxes clutter-free.
5.  **Healthcare:** Machine learning algorithms are used in healthcare to
    diagnose diseases, predict patient outcomes, and personalize treatment
    plans.

## What is Machine Learning?

#### Actually ML is everywhere

<br>

6.  **Marketing:** Machine learning algorithms are used in marketing to
    predict customer behavior, target advertising, and optimize pricing
    strategies.
7.  **Chatbots:** Machine learning algorithms are used to build chatbots
    that can answer customer questions and provide support in real-time.
8.  **Autonomous Driving:** Machine learning algorithms are used to develop
    self-driving cars that can navigate roads and make decisions based on
    real-time data.
9.  **Predictive Maintenance:** Machine learning algorithms are used to
    predict when equipment and machinery are likely to fail, allowing
    companies to schedule maintenance before a breakdown occurs.
10. **Natural Language Processing:** Machine learning algorithms are used
    in natural language processing to translate languages, summarize text,
    and analyze sentiment in written or spoken language.

## ML Concept

#### `AI, ML, and Deep Learning`

-   Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning; these terms
    appear a lot in newspapers and books these days, right? Let's summarize
    it first.

-   **`Machine learning`**, which we will learn in this class, is, as
    already mentioned, that a machine learns from data to create a model
    and predict new situations.

-   **`Deep learning`** is one of many techniques of machine learning.

    -   Have you ever heard of artificial neural networks? Deep learning is
        one of the machine learning techniques that uses artificial neural
        networks.

    -   AlphaGo, mentioned above, is also a machine learning technology
        that applies deep learning. In other words, deep learning exists
        within machine learning.

    -   Deep learning learns large amounts of data through artificial
        neural networks.

-   **`Artificial intelligence`** is a technology that allows machines to
    mimic human behavior.

    -   It's a very broad concept, meaning any technology that makes you
        behave a little more humane.

-   After all, all of these technologies are meant to help people make
    decisions and act.

## Have you used ChatGPT?

<br>

-   **`ChatGPT`** is a part of the field of Machine Learning, specifically
    the subfield of Natural Language Processing (**NLP**).

    -   It is a type of language model that is trained using deep learning
        techniques, such as deep neural networks.

-   In NLP, language models are used to generate text that is semantically
    and contextually appropriate given a prompt.

    -   This is done by training the model on a large corpus of text data
        and using that training to generate new text that is similar to the
        text seen in the training data.

-   ChatGPT is a specific type of language model that is fine-tuned on a
    large corpus of conversational text, making it particularly well-suited
    for tasks such as generating responses in a chatbot or answering
    questions.

-   The transformer architecture and the large number of parameters in
    ChatGPT allow it to capture long-range dependencies between the input
    and output, making it capable of generating coherent and contextually
    appropriate text even when the prompt is very long.

## What are you afraid of?

<br>

When you think of artificial intelligence, some people immediately think of
**Terminator** or **Ultron**. **You don't have to be afraid.**

## This is the reality of AI

<br>

Because, a cute robot like below is enough to help our thought

-   The technologies that allow machines to think for themselves are still
    .. very, very rudimentary (elementary).

<!-- -->

-   However, the development of technology is very fast, so if you know the
    principles and basics of machine learning and can apply it to your
    life, the future will be much brighter in 5 or 10 years.

-   Arthur Clark, now deceased science fiction writer, said this.

-   Things that only appeared in sci-fi movies when I was a kid are already
    happening.

-   With the development of the Internet and communications, truly magical
    things are already happening.

-   You now carry a supercomputer in your hand, right? (I mean, your
    smartphone!)

-   For me in the past, people who use smartphones today are almost
    wizards.

-   This is one of the things I am somewhat certain of: In the near future,
    programs called data science now will be used as easily as Excel, and
    machine learning will be used as widely as those using smartphones
    today, and anyone can use it.

-   **Let's learn magic a little earlier than others.**

## Course Design

<br>

-   **Pre-class**

    -   Prior to attending the offline (or online streaming Zoom class),
        students are expected to view the recorded lecture delivered by the
        lecturer.

        -   They are encouraged to take an active role in their learning by
            studying the material independently.

        -   The video covers the fundamental concepts of the Machine
            Learning algorithm, including its underlying theory when
            necessary.

        -   To assess their level of understanding, students are required
            to submit discussion posts. This serves as a means for
            evaluating their comprehension of the material.

-   **In-class**

    -   During the class, the lecturer will summarize the pre-class lecture
        and provide additional clarification on the concepts covered.

    -   To reinforce their understanding, students will engage in hands-on
        practice with more advanced code. This will provide them with the
        opportunity to apply their knowledge and develop their coding
        skills.

-   The official in-class time is AM 10:00 \~ 12:00

-   When attendance falls below 1/3 in a class, it may result in a grade of

    F.  

    -   This policy is in place to encourage regular attendance and ensure
        that all students have the opportunity to fully participate in the
        learning experience. It is the responsibility of the students to
        attend classes regularly and stay engaged in their education.

-   The Final Score for the ICPBL is calculated by multiplying the ICPBL
    Team Score with the Individual Peer Review Score.

-   Individual Peer Review Scores are obtained through an anonymous survey
    conducted within the group.

-   It is worth noting that the team assignment is only available for
    domestic students. On the other hand, exchange students are required to
    complete an individual project.
